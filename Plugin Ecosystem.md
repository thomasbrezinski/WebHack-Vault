There are some core plugins, but most are community plugins.
As of [[2023-11-27]], there were 1,306 community plugins available.

All community plugins are open source and go through an initial submission process, but as always, it is inherently risky to run 3rd party code on your machine.

>Due to technical reasons, Obsidian is unable to reliably restrict plugins to specific permissions or access levels. As a result, consider the following examples of what community plugins can do:
>
>- Community plugins can access files on your computer.
>- Community plugins can connect to internet.
>- Community plugins can install additional programs.

You can install most plugins by enabling Community Plugins in your vault and then browsing directly in Obsidian's Community Plugins settings.
