Many users make use of the [Periodic Notes plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) for creating a combination of Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annual notes.

You can enable any combination of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly notes.

By itself, this enables a really accessible approach to periodic reflections. You can use the side calendar to quickly open up today or this week's note, or assign hot keys for the each type of note. You can also set up a basic template within the plugin so that new notes already contain the typical structure or prompts you prefer.

However, if you'd like to make each note contain dynamic links or content, you can use the [Templater Plugin](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) and include templates like:

> <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD dddd", 1, tp.file.title, "YYYY-MM-DD dddd") %>
 
 These templates will get evaluated by Templater when creating notes and allow you to easily embed dynamic links between your notes for things like "Yesterday's Note", "Tomorrow's Note", etc.

> [!warning] Your note naming scheme must be consistent between periodic notes and your Templater scripts, so pick your scheme up front instead of needing to fix all of your notes later.
