## What is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
Obsidian is a powerful notes app that facilitates a wide variety of approaches to building your own digital mind and workflows.

We could compare it to
* Evernote ![[Pasted image 20231127185939.png|20]]
* Bear ![[Pasted image 20231127185958.png|20]]
* Apple Notes ![[Pasted image 20231127185919.png|20]]
* Google Keep ![[Pasted image 20231127185857.png|20]]
* Notion  ![[Pasted image 20231127190013.png|20]]
* etc.
but it offers so much personal customization and flexibility, that I wouldn't consider any a fair comparison.
