1. I have used and abandoned nearly every todo app available
	1. Todoist, Google Tasks, Apple Reminders, Nirvana (for get things done), Wunderlist (RIP), etc.
2. Having my Todos inside the same application that I am using throughout my day has been transformational.
3. I want to start my day with a fresh empty daily note to have a moment to consider my day before being buried by any carry over tasks.
4. I want control over how my previous tasks carry over.

So I wrote turned my preferences into a plugin
https://github.com/thomasbrezinski/obsidian-nested-daily-todos

### Alternatives
[Todoist Plugin](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin) can sync your Todoist items into your note
[Rollover Daily Todos](https://github.com/lumoe/obsidian-rollover-daily-todos) can rollover incomplete todos, but not by section or with some of the alternative checkbox styles
