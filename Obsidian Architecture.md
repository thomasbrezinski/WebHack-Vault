**Your plugin can:**
- Expose a settings page
- Add Ribbon Actions on the sidebar
- Add New Commands
- Create custom Views, which is how Obsidian displays information
	- The editor, file explorer, and graph are all examples of view
- Modify how the editor itself works either during post-processing or live preview
- Much more


Obsidian uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) (CM) as the underlying text editor, and exposes the CodeMirror editor as part of the API.

```ts
import { Editor, Plugin } from "obsidian";

export default class ExamplePlugin extends Plugin {
  async onload() {
    this.addCommand({
      id: "convert-to-uppercase",
      name: "Convert to uppercase",
      editorCallback: (editor: Editor) => {
        const selection = editor.getSelection();
        editor.replaceSelection(selection.toUpperCase());
      },
    });
  }
}
```
